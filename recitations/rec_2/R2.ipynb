It has gained significant popularity in both academic research and industry applications due to its dynamic computational graph, intuitive API, and seamless integration with the Python ecosystem.\n","\n","### Key Characteristics of PyTorch:\n","\n","1. **Pythonic Nature**: PyTorch feels natural to Python programmers, making it easier to learn and integrate with existing Python codebases and libraries.\n","\n","2. **Dynamic Computational Graph**: Unlike static graph frameworks, PyTorch builds graphs on-the-fly (define-by-run), allowing for more flexible model architecture and easier debugging.\n","\n","3. **Tensor Computation**: At its core, PyTorch provides a tensor data structure similar to NumPy arrays but with the ability to run on GPUs for accelerated computing.\n","\n","4. **Automatic Differentiation**: PyTorch includes an automatic differentiation engine called \"autograd\" that enables automatic computation of gradients needed for training neural networks.\n","\n","5. **Production Ready**: With TorchScript and other deployment tools, PyTorch models can be easily transitioned from research to production environments.\n","\n","## PyTorch vs. NumPy\n","\n","If you're already familiar with NumPy from our first recitation, you'll find many similarities with PyTorch:\n","\n","| Feature | NumPy | PyTorch |\n","|---------|-------|---------|\n","| Primary data structure | ndarray | Tensor |\n","| Device support | CPU only | CPU and GPU |\n","| Automatic differentiation | No | Yes |\n","| Broadcasting behavior | Yes | Yes |\n","| API style | Similar | Similar |\n","\n","The main difference is that PyTorch tensors can leverage GPU acceleration and automatically track computations for gradient calculation, making them ideal for deep learning.\n","\n","## What We'll Cover in This Recitation\n","\n","1. **PyTorch Tensors**: Creating, manipulating, and understanding the fundamental data structure\n","2. **Automatic Differentiation**: Understanding how PyTorch computes gradients automatically\n","3. **Building Neural Networks**: Using the nn module to create neural network architectures\n","4. **Training Models**: The training loop, optimizers, and loss functions\n","5. **Data Loading**: Using DataLoader and Dataset classes for efficient data handling\n","6. **Practical Examples**: Hands-on implementations of common deep learning tasks\n","\n","By the end of this recitation, you'll have a solid understanding of PyTorch's core components and be able to implement basic deep learning models.\n","\n","Let's get started!"],"metadata":{"id":"KM-_TV70JuLt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import torch\n","import
